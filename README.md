## Synopsis

An interactive web app of an animated escalator, where the user can ‘Add Man’ or ‘Remove Man’ to add characters onto an Escalator.

## Motivation

To explore the power of CSS animations, and practice creating SVGs in Adobe Illustrator CC.

## Goal

Transform the Escalator into a fully 3d version that users can spin around (using mouse or touch). 
Build a huge library of Escalator people. 
Add custom animations for some characters (for example, several characters will speedily run up the escalator on the left hand side, knocking characters out of the way).
